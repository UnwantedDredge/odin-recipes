        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>This lamb shank recipe was initially given to me as a family favorite from a work buddy. I've prepared it in a slow cooker and made it as easy as possible to prepare. It has a fantastic flavour and the meat just falls off the bone. I have made this in the oven as well and doubled the quantities for 4 people and it tasted just as good, only everybody went in for seconds and there were no leftovers.</p>
