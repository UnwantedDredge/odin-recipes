        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>This lamb shank recipe was initially given to me as a family favorite from a work buddy. I've prepared it in a slow cooker and made it as easy as possible to prepare. It has a fantastic flavour and the meat just falls off the bone. I have made this in the oven as well and doubled the quantities for 4 people and it tasted just as good, only everybody went in for seconds and there were no leftovers.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>⅔ cup sour cream </ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon chili powder </ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground ginger </ul>
        <ul>4 whole cardamom pods, broken </ul>
        <ul>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes </ul>
        <ul>1 cup water </ul>
        <ul>ground nutmeg to taste </ul>
        <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons cornstarch </ul>
        <ul>¼ cup water </ul>
        <ul>1 large onion, cut into wedges </ul>
        <ul>3 lamb shanks </ul>
        <ul>1 (15 ounce) can carrots, drained </ul>
        <ul>1 (15 ounce) can whole new potatoes, drained </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>Stir the sour cream and all-purpose flour together in a small bowl until smooth and set aside. In a separate small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water to make a paste.</ol>
        <ol>Combine the chili powder, coriander, ginger, bouillon cubes, cardamom, tomatoes, water, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Slowly add the cornstarch paste to the tomato mixture, stirring constantly; simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly stir in the sour cream and flour mixture.</ol>
        <ol>Arrange the onions across the bottom of a slow cooker, lay the shanks on top of the onions and pour the prepared tomato mixture over the meat. Place the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms on top of the sauce.</ol>
        <ol>Cover and cook in the slow cooker on High for 8 hours.</ol>
