        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>This recipe was passed from my Yia Yia to her daughter-in-law (my mother) to me. People love this as a Christmas gift. It has gained a big reputation among our friends. One time, my mother donated a small tin of baklava to a church charity auction. It was very competitive, but the price was driven up to $40!</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Syrup</h4>
        <ul>2 cups water </ul>
        <ul>2 cups white sugar </ul>
        <ul>4 whole cloves </ul>
        <ul>½ cinnamon stick </ul>
        <ul>1 lemon, juiced, divided </ul>

        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>1 cup white sugar </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon </ul>
        <ul>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg </ul>
        <ul>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted, or more as needed </ul>
        <ul>20 sheets phyllo dough </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>Stir together water, 2 cups sugar, cloves, cinnamon stick, and 1/2 the lemon juice together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavor blends and syrup consistency is reached, about 15 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 the lemon juice into syrup. Strain and refrigerate until cool, at least 30 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Stir walnuts, 1 cup sugar, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush butter on the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</ol>
        <ol>Lay the phyllo dough out on a clean, dry surface and cover it with plastic wrap. Cover the plastic wrap with a damp towel.</ol>
        <ol>Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough in prepared baking dish and lightly brush with butter. Lay another 1 sheet of phyllo dough on top, brush with butter. Repeat layering and brushing with butter with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough.</ol>
        <ol>Gently spread 1/3 the walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with 3 more sheets of dough.</ol>
        <ol>Spread another 1/3 the walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with 3 more sheets of dough.</ol>
        <ol>Spread the remaining 1/3 walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with the remaining 5 sheets of dough. Cut baklava into 1-inch diamonds.</ol>
        <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Pour cooled syrup over baked baklava and cool for 1 day to absorb syrup.</ol>
