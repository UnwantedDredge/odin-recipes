        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>This three-layer apple pie is a Southern favorite! Full of a mother's love (and apples) that you can be sure you'll never get at home!</p>
            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>½ cup butter</ul>
        <ul>5 Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, quartered, and thinly sliced </ul>
        <ul>3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts </ul>
        <ul>1 cup white sugar, divided </ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided </ul>
        <ul>¼ cup white sugar </ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</ol>
        <ol>Place 1/2 cup butter into a heavy cast iron skillet, and melt butter in the oven. Remove skillet and sprinkle with brown sugar; return to oven to heat while you prepare the apples.</ol>
        <ol>Remove skillet, and place 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of the brown sugar. Top the pie crust with half the sliced apples. Sprinkle apples with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon; place a second pie crust over the apples; top the second crust with the remaining apples, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with the third crust; sprinkle the top crust with 1/4 cup sugar, and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam.</ol>
        <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.</ol>
