        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons olive oil </ul>
        <ul>3 slices bacon, diced </ul>
        <ul>1 large onion, finely chopped </ul>
        <ul>1 stalk celery, finely chopped </ul>
        <ul>1 carrot, finely chopped </ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon dried oregano </ul>
        <ul>3 cloves garlic, minced </ul>
        <ul>1 pound lean ground beef </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar </ul>
        <ul>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons tomato paste </ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons white sugar </ul>
        <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste </ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil </ul>
        <ul>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</ol>
        <ol>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.</ol>
        <ol>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</ol>
