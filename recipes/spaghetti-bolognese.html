        <h1>Stolen Spaghetti Bolognese Recipe</h1>

        <h3>Describe the Dish!</h3>
        <p>Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef. You can also substitute the balsamic vinegar for 1/2 cup of red wine.</p>
